### LSHTM-RUG Advent-of-Code repository.

Clone this repo and it could serve as the structure to help keep your AoC code organized...

Join the LSHTM-RUG [board](https://adventofcode.com/2025/leaderboard/private) with this code: 5153206-c60513a8

Practice on previous year's [puzzles](https://adventofcode.com/2025/events), solutions are available (e.g. [here](https://emilhvitfeldt.github.io/rstats-adventofcode/2024.html))

Wait for the 1st Dec. 2025 midnight EST (UTC-5), or run `NextPuzzleWhen.R`

Complete one or both sections of the daily puzzles.

Share your solution(s) by pushing it to the corresponding daily folder within `AoC2025/`.

The board leaders will receive a small R-related (but physical) gift for their dedication and recognition at our first 2026 meeting.
